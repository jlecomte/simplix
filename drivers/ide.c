 * IDE Hard Disk driver.
 *
 * A great (although non trivial) improvement would be to optimize drive head
 * motion by writing an I/O scheduler implementing a basic elevator algorithm.
 * This means we would need to introduce the notion of I/O request.
 * When choosing which request should execute next, we need to strike
 * a balance between the age of the pending requests, their initial priority
 * (if we support request priorities), and the time it would take for the
 * appropriate drive head to move to the right track to handle a request.
 * Interesting stuff but definitely non trivial! (also I wonder if a parameter
 * of this algorithm would be the actual measured speed of the drive head...)
